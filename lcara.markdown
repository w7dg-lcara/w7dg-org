The LCARA ~ W7DG ~ is an ARRL Affiliated Club and has had up to 100 members.
Due to our many volunteers and their countless hours of service, weâ€™ve helped
make a difference in our community in times of emergency, showing that amateur
radio remains a valuable resource recognized by our local governments and other
organizations.

## Facility
The club operates an array of 5 multi-mode HF stations in its club facility
located northerly of Longview Washington. Frequently active on contest
weekends, the clubhouse provides ample parking and comfortable facilities.

With an elevation of 1000 feet and two towers, the club site has long provided
southwest Washington amateur radio operators with reliable repeater service on
several VHF/UHF bands. Club repeaters are an essential part of Cowlitz County's
emergency communications plan, and receive significant support from the County
Department of Emergency Management.

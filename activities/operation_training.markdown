title: Operation and Training
---

Trainings are held on the **3rd Saturday** of each month
at **10:00 - 15:00 (10 - 3pm)** at the **LCARA Clubhouse**.

This is a great opportunity to get familiar with the equipment at the club station
and learn how to operate different bands and modes from HF through UHF. Get
ready for the next contest, learn about FT8, or just get on the mic.

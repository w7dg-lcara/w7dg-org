Meetings are held on the **4th Wednesday** of each month
at **19:00 (7pm)** at the **LCARA Clubhouse** and are restricted to members.

Discussions can be very detailed and technical regarding station and site
equipment, configuration, maintenance, and improvements. Rag chewing about
incomplete projects on the air is _discouraged_, **please bring your ideas
to the meeting instead.**

Minutes may contain sensitive information and are posted at the clubhouse.

See [Article III Section VIII of Bylaws](https://w7dg-lcara.github.io/static/documents/ConstitutionAndBylaws2021.pdf) for more information.

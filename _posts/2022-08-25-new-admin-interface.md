The new admin interface is mostly working!

Users can add and edit the site from [/admin](/admin), then automatically submit their changes for review via [/publish](/publish). Finally, once the PR merges, the [live site](https://live.w7dg.net) is automatically rebuilt via a webhook call. All frictionless! ðŸ¤ž

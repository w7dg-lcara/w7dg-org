The Lower Columbia Amateur Radio Association (LCARA) had its
beginning on May 30, 1948 when amateur radio operators (hams) responded to the
the Vanport Flood. Amateur radio operators from Washington state reacted with
communication assistance to assist sheriffs and other search and rescue
organizations fulfill their mission. And thus was born the Lower Columbia
Amateur Radio Association (LCARA) which has been in service to the citizens of
Washington state ever since.

## 1: 70th Anniversary

On May 30, 2018 the Lower Columbia Amateur Radio Association celebrated its 70th anniversary with a potluck and a congratulatory letter from Washington state Governor Inslee. The Governor’s letter and a brief history were enshrined in plaques for a wall.

The Governor’s letter reads as follows.

-------------------

State of Washington<br>
Office of the Governor<br>
Greetings from the Governor<br>
May 30, 2018

I am pleased to extend warm greetings to all of those attending the Lower
Columbia Amateur Radio Association’s (LCARA) 70th Anniversary celebration.
Congratulations on this impressive milestone!

Born out of the Vanport Flood of May 30, 1948, LCARA has a long history of
providing critical communications assistance and other emergency services, such
as emergency transport and drone operations, to a broad range of organizations,
including local law enforcement and fire departments, the Civil Air Patrol, the
Coast Guard Auxiliary, hospitals, and the Red Cross. LCARA plays a key role in
the region’s preparedness planning and overall readiness to respond to natural
disasters and other disruptive events. Additionally, LCARA contributes to
advances in space science and communications, as well as international goodwill
through regular contacts with other countries.

I applaud LCARA members for their commitment to adding to the strength and
resilience of the region and our state as a whole. Few service organizations
achieve this longevity while remaining agile and embracing advanced technology
as well as new opportunities to give back. I am inspired by your selflessness,
and I hope your example will motivate others to give back to their community in
a meaningful way.

Thank you for coming, and please accept my best wishes for a memorable
celebration and continued success in the years ahead.

Very truly yours,<br>
Jay Inslee<br>
Governor

**The brief history of LCARA on the plaque read as follows.**

The Vanport Flood of May 30, 1948 was disastrous for Washington state, Oregon,
Montana, Idaho, and British Columbia in Canada. Fifty people died and 46,000
people lost their homes. It resulted in over 102 million dollars damage in the
United States alone. Amateur radio operators from Washington state reacted with
communication assistance to assist sheriffs and other search and rescue
organizations fulfill their mission. And thus was born the Lower Columbia
Amateur Radio Association (LCARA) which has been in service to the citizens of
Washington state ever since. On May 30, 2018 the LCARA celebrates its 70th
anniversary with a celebration.

Since that time, the LCARA has increased their technical expertise by using a
variety of voice, text, image, and data communications modes to include Morse
code, very-low-power, and fast/slow scan television signals. LCARA has access
to frequency allocations throughout the radio frequency spectrum to enable
communication across a city, region, country, continent, the world, or even
into space.

* Contributed to international good will by making contact with many countries as evidenced by the many colorful QSL cards on our wall.
* Trained and qualified many new amateur radio operators throughout its 70 years of operation.
* Helped develop and deploy radio substitutes for the internet for emergency services agencies in case part of the internet goes down.
* Practiced with other agencies and organizations at Emergency Operating Centers preparing for the Cascadia Earthquake and other disasters.
* Provided communication and medical coordination for athletic events such as Tour-de-Blast and Blooms to Brews.
* In space advances we have shared information on
  * communication with and through satellites, the International Space Station, and meteor scatter propagation
  * Earth – Moon - Earth (EME) radio signals
* Ham radio is playing a part in a possible eventual trip to our nearest star, about 4 light years away. In Quest to Reach Alpha Centauri, Breakthrough Starshot launched the world’s smallest spacecraft using the amateur radio frequency of 437.325 Mhz. Breakthrough Starshot, a multi-faceted program to develop and launch practical interstellar space missions, successfully flew its first spacecraft in June 2017.
* Contributed towards National Defense through the Military Auxiliary Radio System (MARS).
* Amateur radio operators, using battery or generator powered equipment, often provide essential communications services when regular channels are unavailable due to natural disaster or other disruptive events. In addition to our close work with the Sheriff’s Department, we work with organizations such as the Civil Air Patrol (USAF Auxiliary), Coast Guard Auxiliary, Fire Departments, Police Departments, hospitals, Red Cross, and other organizations to provide emergency services. One of many examples is the emergency transport of kidney dialysis patients.
* LCARA is implementing microwave communication on a practical basis.
* LCARA leads the state of Washington and the United States of America in emergency services drone operations and now operates with 5 drones, 7 drone pilots, FAA authorization to operate at night, and a trained ground team. In this great state we have operated from the Pacific Ocean to the borders of Idaho, Oregon, and Canada.
* In 2017 in training and operations LCARA operations totaled 137 days, 2,343 hours, and 14,212 miles.

## 2: Memories with Stu

Stuart Farmer K7WF, a senior LCARA member, recalls the early days of our club.
Stu is very reluctant to talk about himself, but he has served our club in many
ways over the years, is an Extra Class ham, and has 315 QSL contacts throughout
the world.

“In 1948 the club was formed as a result of serious flooding in the area, when
hams were responsible for manning the dikes and reporting any possible areas
that needed more sandbags.

As a result of their efficiency a local lumber company donated a “Line Shack”
which was erected on property above the present clubhouse at the East end of
Laulainen Road. There is now a large water tank at the same location. This was
the first clubhouse. (There is an unconfirmed rumor that the minimum age for
joining LCARA at that time was 21 years old because of unnamed activities.)

The club was later moved to the Juvenile Detention Center on Croy Street in
North Kelso. This was approximately in 1967. I joined the club in 1969 after
getting my Novice license WN7OMX. I later held the position of
Secretary/Treasurer, and later as President.

The present clubhouse, at 966 Lone Oak Road, was leased from Radio Station
KBAM, and was erected by members in 1975, donating their time as well as each
giving 100 dollars towards material. A plaque is on display at the club,
showing each member who made a donation. KBAM was later brought out by Intercom
communication, and we are leasing the property from them at this time on a
month to month basis.

The original call of the club was W7NCW, but on the death of Ray Sechler we
applied, and successfully obtained his call of W7DG. Ray had been the CW (Morse
code) instructor to so many of us over the years that we decided to honor him
in this way.

Craig Moore, WA7ILC, passed away in about 2008. While in the military in
Alaska, he used to copy five letter groups sent in Morse code from Russia. He
worked as a sergeant on the night shift in the Police Department. He was a very
big guy. Once another ham said his call sign ending in ILC stood for
“Illiterate Little Cop.” Craig good naturedly chased him around the room a few
times.

There were six founding members. Three of them were:

- Dr. John Nelson W7AOB
- Henry Hale W7FON
- Rolly Mitzke

Winfield O. Jones was a Prudential Insurance Agent who also liked to also ride
a big Harley Davidson motorcycle. He and his wife Eloise passionately loved
each other and both loved to argue. One of the points they loved to argue about
was whenever Winfield got a speeding ticket for 100 dollars, he was supposed to
give his wife another 100 dollars. Eloise passed first. When Winfield passed
other hams who knew them both carried his casket. As soon as he was laid to
rest, there was a loud clap of thunder and bright lightening from above. One of
the hams said, “See, they are fighting already!”

## 3: Annual Summaries

#### 2018

In 2018 we continued to expand drone operations, give amateur radio VEC tests
for new hams and those wishing to advance, performed Field Day, gave support to
both the Blooms to Brews marathon in April the Tour de Blast bike race in June,
grew our funds with volunteer activities, further developed microwave
communication, and through the Auxiliary Communication Service (A.C.S.)
coordinated emergency services with other agencies.

On May 19 we held a Mock Search. As always, sneaky Connie Greeley KB7AYY led us
on a long merry difficult search for the Emergency Locater Transmitter (ELT).

On June 16-17 we did a fundraising event of a Potato Bar in Woodland on their
Planters Day led by Carl Gray K7ECW.

Field Day is an opportunity for hams to get out in a field and starting from
scratch with nothing build and operate multiple radio stations and communicate
with people all over the world. Several camped out all night. In 2018 we
successfully put up on our 40 foot tower a hexagonal directed beam field
antenna with 6, 10, 12, 15, 17, and 20 meters as well as a 40 and 80 meter
straight wire lead in. We also were able to maintain continuous power with a
solar power generator and a battery and follow amateur radio satellites.

This year the Tour de Blast (June 23) and Field Day (June 22-24) happened on
the same day. As a measure of our depth and flexibility, the LCARA was able to
cover both events. Randy Greeley NU7D led the Tour de Blast and Steve Andrews
K7KO led field day.

We officially received our Grant from RIZAD for: Two 100% Water Proof Drones, A
250 Gallon Propane Tank Plus Fuel for LCARA and a Projector. In addition
through a donation and purchase we now have two wide screen televisions for
better presentations in the LCARA clubhouse.

We held a Christmas dinner potluck on December 8.
